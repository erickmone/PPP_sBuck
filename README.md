This repository is part of the paper:

 *Digital implementation of a Delay-Based Control with Step-Down Power Electronics Converters* by E. Moreno-Negrete, Regina Ramos, M.J. Carrizosa, Pedro Alou, Islam Boussaada, & C.-F. Mendez-Barrios (to be publish on IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology)
 
 Recognizing that the controller parameters algebraic functions are *big enough* to attach in the paper, here we attach the MATLAB functions for the elimination produced polinomial, and the PIR controller gains. The user's have to look at the running test section as a demo to get the numerical value of controllers' parameters.
